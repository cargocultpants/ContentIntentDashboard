# ContentIntentDashboard
The ContentIntent Dashboard is a tool that **_clients_** can use to submit social media **_content_** (e.g. articles, videos, blog posts, etc.) to our administrative team. The administrative team (i.e. **_adminstrators_**) can then **_score_** the content. The client can then see those scores and compare them to each other in order to **_analyze_**, **_re-evaluate_** and/or **_optimize_** their **_social media marketing_** strategy, if necessary.
